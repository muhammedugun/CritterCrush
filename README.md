# 🎮 **Critter Crush**

Critter Crush is a Candy Crush-like match-three mobile game, as the name and visuals suggest. The game has a theme of cute animals and 20 levels. 
The purpose of making this game is to learn how to use and integrate mobile plugins into the game. 
I implemented various topics such as mobile notifications, ad displays, in-app purchase integration on this game. 
I verified that I was able to run all this work on a real game.
